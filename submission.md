## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

_your answer here_

Search

- Debounce the search field so it doesn't search on every key stroke
- Add a minimum amount of chars for searching
- Fuzzy search

Would be nice to see a list of the filters you've applied, as not clear when dropdowns are closed

Custom radio buttons

I would look into the performance. I would prefer not to manipulate the data that much client side, so would prefer to create a service to get the options for the filters, rather than extracting them on front end.

I could also some more checks for clean data - being able to see the data I knew it was all clean but irl I would put in some checks for dodgy data.

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

I really really wanted to add a class for exercise 1 but I did not.
It wasn't clear if I was allowed to add classes when it said "do not modify the DOM structure provided."

I left it as the order of the radios as "Books" and "Movies" instead of movies and books (as in mockup) because it's alphabetical (everything else was alphabetical, why not this??)

The image for the exorcist was broken so I replaced it with a kitten.

Whoever made this exercise has good taste in films.
