## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

_your answer here_

Added some more checks for clean data - being able to see the data I knew it was all clean but irl I would put in some checks for dodgy data 


Woudln't like to manipulate the data that much client side 

I've hardcoded the genres and types into the filters 
- I would hope that I can get these from the API 
- I could have filtered the data to retrieve these dynamically but this would not be very scalable if you had thousands of items

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

_your answer here_

Added a class for the first exercise - if I were to do it without adding the class I would : 

but that seems gross and unrealistic 



## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?
