## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

_your answer here_

Added some more checks for clean data - being able to see the data I knew it was all clean but irl I would put in some checks for dodgy data

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

_your answer here_

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

_your answer here_

Originally did one state object with all needed but broke into multiple states 

Whoever made this exercise has good taste in films
