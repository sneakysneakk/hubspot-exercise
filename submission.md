## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

_your answer here_

Added some more checks for clean data - being able to see the data I knew it was all clean but irl I would put in some checks for dodgy data

Wouldn't like to manipulate the data that much client side

Debounce the search field
Add a minimum amount of chars for searching
Fuzzy search

Would be nice to see a list of the filters you've applied, as not clear when dropdowns are closed

Custom radio buttons - using default and styling is not consistent across browsers

Did some weird text-align:right styles on my clear button

Would look into the performance a bit.

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

_your answer here_

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

_your answer here_

I really really wanted to add a class for exercise 1 but I did not.

I left it as books and movies instead on movies and books because alphabetical (everything else was alphabetical, why not this??)

The image for the exorcist was broken so I replaced it with a kitten

Whoever made this exercise has good taste in films
