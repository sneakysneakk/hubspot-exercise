## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

_your answer here_

Added some more checks for clean data - being able to see the data I knew it was all clean but irl I would put in some checks for dodgy data 


Wouldn't like to manipulate the data that much client side 

Debounce the search field 
Add a minimum amount of chars for searching 
Fuzzy search 

Would be nice to see a list of the filters you've applied, as not clear when dropdowns are closed 


## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

_your answer here_

Added a class for the first exercise - if I were to do it without adding the class I would : 

but that seems gross and unrealistic 



## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

_your answer here_

Filtered dynamically so that API changes wouldn't break features

I left it as books and movies instead on movies and books because alphabetical (everything else was alphabetical, why not this??)

The image for the exorcist was broken so I replaced it with a kitten 

Whoever made this exercise has good taste in films
